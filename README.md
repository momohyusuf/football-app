## Overview

This project was built to enlighten my knowledge about making multiple calls from a Single Api that has multiple endpoints. Also to understand how data is structured in a database.

### The Project Goal

Users should be able to:
1.Get latest football news
2.Get football fixtures and current live scores
3.Get league standing
4.Get team, players and coach information and stats
4.get predictions
